# End-to-End Investment Banker RAG Chatbot using Intelâ€™s Neural Chat LLM

## Project Overview

This project provides an end-to-end solution for building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot, specifically designed for investment banking use cases. The chatbot utilizes Intel's Neural Chat LLM, leveraging document-based information to answer queries effectively, without relying on any external APIs. The model processes and answers questions from a set of provided documents, offering efficient and contextually relevant responses tailored to investment banking professionals.

The core functionality of the chatbot is to integrate with a set of financial documents or reports, ingest them into a knowledge base, and then use a fine-tuned language model to generate answers based on the ingested content. This makes it a valuable tool for investment bankers who need quick, document-based answers to their queries.
